	"description": "One of the flagship assignments for Graphics at Tech is the Ray Tracer. I was given a framework in which to work that handled loading and reading scene files containing shapes and lights, and I was tasked with rendering the scene using ray tracing. My attempt turned out VERY well, earning a 100% on the assignment. I am particularly proud of the organization of the recursive part of the code, as I was able to start and finish it without refactoring, and I had only minimal bugs.",
