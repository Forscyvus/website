	"description": "One of my friends created a Twitter bot that tweets tweets constructed from another of my friends's tweets. Everyone in our friend group loves it, and it inspired me to whip out my old friend Python and create this twitter bot! Beamer Bot stores tweets from ~30 of my friends and, every hour, tweets as one of them. The trick is that then anyone can try to guess who the tweet was generated from! This is still a work in progress but version one is up and running. (It probably hasn't crashed).",
