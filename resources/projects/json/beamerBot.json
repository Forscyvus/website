	"description": "One of my friends created a Twitter bot that tweets tweets constructed from another of my friends's tweets. Everyone in our friend group loves it, and it inspired me. I whipped out my old friend Python and created this twitter bot that stores tweets from ~30 of our friends and every hour tweets as one of them. The trick is that then anyone can guess who the tweet was generated from! This is still a work in progress but version one is up and running. (It probably hasn't crashed).",
