	"description": "For my fraternity's rush website I created a little fighting-game style roster doodad to introduce the Brothers. Working with a few other artists, I made 32x32 pixelized portraits for everyone. I then hacked together a JS canvas to showcase them all together. Eventually I will go through and redo the webpage so that it's easier to work with and looks better, but I am really proud of my sprite work. On the actual site, you can see real pictures of the people to judge for yourself how well I did.",
